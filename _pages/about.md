Hello, I'm Raiffa! I am a PhD student at the University of Central Florida in Computer Science with a focus in Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality. Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant with UCF's VARLab. My current research interests are in VR locomotion and redirected walking. I am also interested in animation and virtual production and always looking for collaborators.
